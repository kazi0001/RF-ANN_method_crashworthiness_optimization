# RF-ANN_method_crashworthiness_optimization
This study constructed a multi-modal system for intelligent product synthesis/design utilizing the Keras Python library that combines random forest (RF) classification and artificial neural network (ANN) regression models in the TensorFlow back-end. The RF-ANN model was trained on experimental data for six distinct crashworthiness characteristics to forecast the optimal hexagonal angle for a woven roving glass/epoxy composite material ring system and the loading conditions required to attain the necessary mechanical strength. The created RF-ANN model successfully forecasted the optimal configuration of the composite for different random sets of crashworthiness characteristics.
